An easy way to make obsidian KB cloud-compatible

# Ideas
## Christian discussion App
Main goal that everyone should have being on the app - **An open search for the closest truth.**
### Features:
- Robust truth weight metric assigned to each statement. Probably determined by community. Perhaps similar to community notes on X.
- Easy UI/UX for layman/scholars to contribute/refute ongoing discussions.
- Accurate summary of long chain of discussion and thoughts.
- everything should be easily linked to everything.
- Should be a visualisation as seen in Obsidian visualisation
  - Think of how to categorise ideas. Obsidian has a limitation where it doesn't allow an idea to subsume a sub-idea. E.g. If I have a node titled 'Ephesians', but I also want to visualise Eph 1:2, it won't appear as two distinct nodes. I want it so that when i click on the 'Ephesians' node, it'll expand and show all the smaller ephesian nodes in it.
